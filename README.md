# Learn Core Node.js üöÄ
It's time to learn Node core before you bury yourself in npm packages.

## Introduction

### Prerequisites üöß
Before you jump into the actual content, here is what you need to come up with:

* Familiarity with JavaScript
* Familiarity with Terminal

### Setting Up Your Workstation üíª
Let's set up the development environment before we proceed any further. Here's what you need:

* A text editor
* A terminal
* Node.js, preferably greater than/equal to 8.x.x LTS (Long Term Stable)

### Story of Node.js (Caution: This is so long and only for tech hipsters üë®üèª‚Äçüíª)
It all started from Ryan Dahl original Node.js Intro presentation given in 2009: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztspvPYybIY

Initially, Node did not gain much traction, people thought that JavaScript is the language not suited for server-side serious stuff. Ruby on Rails was also a hot thing back then. But Ryan continued evangelizing Node.js

In 2010, Isaac Schlueter created NPM (Node Package Manager) to host reusable Node modules. NPM made Node.js much more practical. So we can say that npm is one of those forces that popularized Node.js back then.

Another project that was being evangelized in early 2009 was MongoDB. Much of the developers were not sold on the idea of the NoSQL database. Why developers would switch to such a database? JSON was not a heavily used data exchange format back then. XML and Soap APIs were largely overtaking the market.

At the same time, social media APIs began to popularize RESTful JSON APIs. As social media sites grew in popularity, the use of JSON became very common to exchange data. At that time, the idea to store JSON documents as persistent data started making perfect sense to developers. Storing and retrieving JSON data in a column of RDBMS started taking a lot of work. So why just store the JSON directly? 
But using JSON directly on the server with languages like PHP, Ruby or Java was still no picnic. These languages do not have JSON like data structure to convert to and from JSON to be used dynamically. Here comes Node.js, as Node.js is JavaScript, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) was a native feature, using objects format containing key-value pairs. So in Node, MongoDB found a partner in arms. And both projects started benefitting heavily from JSON usage. But as of mid-2010, there was still significant resistance to Node.js

In 2010, Google invited Ryan to give a talk [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6k8lTrAE2g] on Node.js as part of its series on emerging web technologies. The version of Ryan presented back then was still far from production usages. Node was still looking for a miracle to happen and it happened within the next 12 months with the introduction of the following projects:
* ExpressJS
* Mongoose
* AngularJS
* Node for Windows

#### Express
Express extracted away all boilerplate and created somewhat stable APIs on top of unstable Node core. This largely simplified the usage of Node.js for the masses. As ExpressJS was an MVC framework, it provided an easier path to Full-Stack Ruby on Rails engineer to get interested in Node.

#### Mongoose
Mongoose came out in 2010 and made it very easy to use MongoDB with Node.

#### AngularJS
Similarly, in 2010, Google released AngularJS and this put the move forward of JSON and a common form of data sharing that‚Äôs understood natively by both front-end and back-end.
So the people who adopted this stack got an extra benefit that was not available on other platforms. Hence, the MEAN stack was born.

#### Node for Windows
Although things were pretty good in MEAN stack those who were using raw Node outside of MEAN stack had some instability issues because Node, back then, was a project of an individual. It needed core contributors and a governing body.
This path was paved by Joyent, ultimately. Joyent hired Ryan Dahl and also purchased the trademark for Node. Joyent also confirmed the stability, reliability, and security of the Node.
And within a year, Joyent delivered on this promise and in partnership with Microsoft, Joyent released Node for Windows, opening Node to a much wider audience.

#### From 2011 to 2015: Node.js getting matured
From 2011 until now, Node has progressed in largely predictable ways.
In 2015, there was a rift among developers and doubts were raised that Joyent wanted to take Node in a different direction as compared to developers needs, so some devs forked Node and named it as io.js but later, it was merged back and the governance of the project was taken from Joyent to a unanimous body called The Node.js Foundation and till today, it‚Äôs being maintained by the Node.js Foundation.
Similarly, in 2015, the first non-beta version of Node was released.
Despite the great advancements, not all the changes have been worth celebrating. Most of the people/companies who adopted Node after 2012, didn‚Äôt adopt it for its runtime, CLI or built-in modules, but because of its largest ecosystem and the speed with which they can build applications using npm modules even without knowing how Node.js works.

Today we have an entire generation of developers who know MEAN stack, Mongoose, Bootstrap but they don‚Äôt know Node. The reason is obvious, some 5% of hipsters developed npm packages and the other 95% just used them without knowing how they work. People adopted Node, not because of Node but because of npm.

This ecosystem although it was very important and necessary at the start, for example, if there wouldn‚Äôt have been npm, Node might not have been at the same place it‚Äôs today. But it doesn‚Äôt mean that we should keep on relying on plenty of frameworks now as the core Node.js APIs are very much stable now. But most Node developers don‚Äôt even know about core Node APIs. They‚Äôre just an expert of Express and Mongoose, not necessarily Node.

*We‚Äôre going to reverse this trend in this writeup! üòé*
